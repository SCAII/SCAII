General format: I’ll put the candidate (3, etc), a decision point, and an analysis.
If there’s no decision point, it’s of the whole file. 

Candidate 3. (Main Task 3) (steps:123	DPs: 1,56,99)
D2 - Attacks a big tower with higher HP for no reason. Chart says paranoia on city damage
	
Candidate 4. (steps:153	DPs: 1,62,94)
D1 - Goes after full HP big tower - chart reveals it’s because it shortening its life limits random noise (since it’s not going to be around to see anything too bad).
	

Candidate 6. (steps:169	DPs: 1,37,108)
D1 - Attacks tower with meaningfully higher HP.
                        D3 - Goes after a big tower & dies when it could do a small tower and get a bonus
	

Candidate 7. (steps:110	DPs: 1,75)
D1 - Goes after a big fort with more health, when it could have done a weaker big fortSimilar to previous
                        D2 - Borderline, could maybe kill small tower


Candidate 8. (Main Task 4) (steps:119	DPs: 1,63,105)
D1 - High HP big tower again

Candidate 9. (steps:119	DPs: 1,59)
D2 - Picks a big tower when it could pick a small, then dies

Candidate 10 (Main Task 1). (steps:135	DPs: 1,61,82,114)
D1 - Same bug as before, but a tank is present in this game (not present in earlier ones)

Candidate 16 (Main Task 2). (steps:153	DPs: 1,59,82,121)

Candidate 20. (steps:128	DPs: 1,61,93)
Has to pick a friend to kill, but has no bugs

Candidate 24. (steps:158	DPs: 1,59,135)
Picks a HP small over a low HP big it could kill to get a lot of points (the exact opposite of the problem we’ve been seeing regularly in the earlier ones).

Candidate 27 (steps:134	DPs: 1,71,92)
Instance of defending a city (no bugs)

Candidate 28 (steps:254	DPs: 1,71,134,222)
Forced to attack a fort or city, but picks a higher HP fort, over a smaller HP one that’d give fewer negative points from Friendly Damage

Candidate 29 (Tutorial)  (steps:193	DPs: 1,75,124)
Same conundrum as 28, but it picks correctly (no bug)
